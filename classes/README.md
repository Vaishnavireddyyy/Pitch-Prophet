## 🧾 Project Overview

**Pitch Prophet** is a Java-based application designed to help users create, manage, and evaluate pitch decks using core Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system simulates the process of building pitch decks while storing and analyzing past submissions. In future versions, an optional Python-based machine learning module will provide feedback and evaluation on pitch quality.

---

## 🧩 Problem

Startup founders and students often struggle with:

- Structuring a clear and compelling pitch.
- Understanding what to include on each slide.
- Receiving meaningful feedback before presenting.
- Managing versions or records of past pitch decks.

---

## 💡 Solution

**Pitch Prophet** provides a structured and object-oriented solution:

1. A **menu-driven interface** to guide users in creating their pitch decks.
2. Stores past pitches using **file I/O** or a simple database.
3. Applies **OOP concepts** to model decks, slides, and users.
4. Optional future integration of a **Python-based ML model** via API to evaluate pitch quality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔧 Core Technologies
- **Java (Core + OOP)** – for system logic and application structure
- **File I/O** – to save pitch decks and session history
- **(Optional)** JDBC / SQLite – if database storage is used

### 🧠 Optional ML Integration
- **Python (Flask or FastAPI)** – for machine learning models (e.g., evaluating tone, structure)
- **HTTP API communication** – Java calls Python API for pitch evaluation

### 💻 User Interface
- **Console-based UI** (menu-driven CLI)
- *(Optional)* GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX in later versions

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧱 **Pitch Deck Creation**
  - Create structured pitch decks (Problem, Solution, Market, etc.)
  - Save and load decks using file I/O

- 🗃️ **Deck Management**
  - View, edit, delete existing decks
  - Browse pitch history

- 🎯 **OOP-Based Architecture**
  - Classes for Deck, Slide, User, Evaluator
  - Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism

- 📊 **Evaluation Module (Future Scope)**
  - Python ML model evaluates clarity, structure, keywords
  - Feedback via API integration

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. User runs the Java application via console or GUI.
2. Main menu provides options: Create Deck, View Decks, Edit, Delete, Evaluate.
3. Each deck is stored locally with structured information.
4. In future versions, decks can be sent to an API for AI-based evaluation and feedback.

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- Add GUI support with **JavaFX**.
- Integrate **Python ML model** for automated pitch scoring.
- Implement **cloud-based storage** and **user login system**.
- Export decks to **PDF or PowerPoint** format.

---

## 📜 Outcome

The outcome of the Pitch Prophet project is derived by analyzing pitch conditions, weather, match type, and venue history to calculate a score prediction.
